# Basics of Statistics
## Probability
* One can think of events as sets
  * Set operations are defined: $A \cup B,A \cap B,\bar{A}$ \ $B$
* $P(A \cup B)=P(A)+P(B) if {A\cap B} =\emptyset$
* `Independence` $P(A,B)\equiv P(A\cap B)= P(A)P(B)$
* Conditional probability $P(A|B)={{P(A,B)} \over {P(B)}}$
## Bayes theorem
* We have some knowledge about event B
  * Prior probability $P(B)$ fo $B$
* We get new information $A$
  * $P(A)$
  * $P(A|B)$ probability of A can occur given B has occured
* New(update) knowledge about B
  * Posterior probability $P(B|A)$
## $P(B|A)={{P(A|B)P(B)}\over{P(A)}}$
